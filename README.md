# MyStockPriceChecker
Sample app for checking stock quotes via ticker symbols.

This app has been tested on a Google Pixel 2 running the latest Android P beta, as well as a Google Play enabled Nexus 5X emulator running OS version 8.1.

Features:
* Enter ticker symbol and see latest price via the IEX API
* See history of ticker symbols searches and associated prices.
* In the history list, prices are color-coordinated to match wins (green) or losses (red).
* In the history list, there are four options for manipulating data:
  * Quotes can be filtered by WINNERS, LOSERS, or ALL.
  * The history list can also be cleared via the CLEAR DATA option.
* Clicking on the price in the history list goes to a details screen with relevant details about the quote.
